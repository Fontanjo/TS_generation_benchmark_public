Compile everything with 

		javac -cp commons-math3-3.6.1/commons-math3-3.6.1.jar TimeSeriesGenerator.java Tools.java Dba.java 


To run the code, "java Dba XXXX", where XXXX is the path to a dataset

The dataset should be a ".csv" file with time series in the rows. The first element of each row is a number indicating the class of the time series.
The class number has no impact on the code, it's just a survival from when the code was used with UCR datasets. 



TODO:

	- allow to read ","-separated files, with time series in the columns
	- ev. allow to specify output path, or at least make it more completed (create new package for each ts name, include the size in the output name, ...)
	- allow more parameters, such as generated ts length, ...
	- allow parameter to generate same number of ts as existing ones
